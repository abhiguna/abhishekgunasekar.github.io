# About Me

I am a technology-first professional with a background in distributed systems engineering, transitioning into investment banking to specialize in Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) sectors. With a 3.95 GPA in Computer Science from Purdue University, experience at Deloitte and Amazon, and a forthcoming MS/MBA from Harvard, I bring deep technical insight to capital markets analysis.

My goal is to drive strategic deals that shape the future of the technology landscape.
